# 1. Testing in E3SMv2

In summer 2022, Hui implemented the revised coupling in E3SMv2
and performed some testing following 
[E3SM's new code review and new feature process](https://acme-climate.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DOC/pages/3438608385/E3SM+Code+Review+and+New+Feature+Process).
See notes [here](2022_v2/2022_v2_notes.md).

# 2. Integration and testing in the v3atm repo

In fall/winter 2022, the revised coupling was implemented in 
E3SM's v3atm fork for testing with other physics/chemistry
parameterization features developed during E3SM phase 2.

# 3. Intergration to E3SM master for v3

As of Feburary 2023, we are working on integrating the revised coupling
to E3SM master as a stealth feature which could become a default in v3.
More details of the integration efforts can be found [here](2023_v3/2023_v3_notes.md).
